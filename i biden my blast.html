                                <p class="about-pera1 mb-25">Joe Biden on Monday wrapped up a more than 50-year
                                    political career, but promised that “we're not leaving the fight,” as he bid
                                    farewell to the presidency and flew to California to unwind with his family and ease
                                    back into private life.</p>
                                <p class="about-pera1 mb-25">Biden spoke not long after watching his successor,
                                    Republican President Donald Trump, pledge during his inaugural address to
                                    "completely and totally reverse” everything that his Democratic predecessor did.</p>
                                <p class="about-pera1 mb-25">
                                    In the final hours before the noontime transfer of executive power, Biden extended
                                    courtesies to the man he had turned out of the Oval Office four years ago. Trump
                                    denied losing the 2020 election and refused to offer similar niceties to Biden upon
                                    his inauguration in 2021.

                                    The bitter cold day opened with Biden and his wife, Jill, receiving Trump, and his
                                    wife, Melania, for a traditional Inauguration Day meet-and-greet over tea at the
                                    White House.

                                    “Welcome home,” Biden told Trump.

                                    Afterward, the rivals, who share a history of political animosity, rode in a
                                    limousine to the Capitol where Trump was sworn in as the 47th president.

                                    “Our recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible
                                    betrayal," Trump said about the work of the Biden administration. Biden sat
                                    expressionless in the front row.

                                    As Trump gave his address, the residence staff at the White House got to work
                                    clearing out the remainder of Biden's belongings so they could move Trump and his
                                    family back in. The work of turning over the White House includes redecorating the
                                    Oval Office.

                                    Walls in the press offices that were bare in the morning after most of the staff had
                                    ended their government service were decorated by midafternoon with fresh photographs
                                    of Trump.

                                    After Trump's address, the new president and his wife walked the Bidens outside to a
                                    Marine helicopter that had been waiting on the Capitol grounds to fly them to Joint
                                    Base Andrews for a farewell event with his staff.

                                    “We couldn't have done anything we did without you," Biden told those who worked for
                                    his administration in the White House. “No president gets to choose the moment they
                                    enter history, but they get to choose the team they enter history with, and we chose
                                    the best damn team in the world."

                                    Even though they may feel “knocked down” by the turn of events, he said what was
                                    important was how quickly they get back up.

                                    “We're leaving office. We're not leaving the fight,” Biden said, urging them to stay
                                    engaged.

                                    And he appeared to joke about Trump's speech, chuckling as he said, “we heard the
                                    inaugural address today. We got a lot more to do.” Biden then made the sign of the
                                    cross and everyone laughed.

                                    He and the first lady then walked across the tarmac to the familiar blue-and-white
                                    Air Force plane he flew on as president for the flight to Santa Ynez, California..

                                    this week, delivering farewell speeches to his diplomatic corps, military leaders
                                    and the nation at large, his appearances belied a grim reality: This is not how he’d
                                    hoped his half-century career in Washington would end.</p>
                                <p class="about-pera1 mb-25">Biden leaves office on Monday reluctantly, firm in the view
                                    he had more to give and more to accomplish, if less sure his health and vigor would
                                    have kept up.
                                </p>
                                <p class="about-pera1 mb-25">
                                    He’ll bring with him a record of accomplishment but also lingering resentment over
                                    the way his political career ended. He no longer speaks regularly with some onetime
                                    allies who pushed him from the race; many in his party blame him for handing the
                                    White House to Donald Trump. And he’ll depart amid a strained relationship with his
                                    No. 2 and replacement on the ticket, Vice President Kamala Harris.

                                    The capital city that will recede from view as he departs on his helicopter is now
                                    the domain of his archrival Trump, whose return to Washington is the very outcome
                                    Biden sought most to prevent. Instead of being remembered as an American statesman
                                    who vanquished Trump once and for all, as he thought he had after his 2020 victory,
                                    he’ll be seen as an interim president between two administrations led by a man he
                                    once labeled a fascist and a threat to democracy.

                                    “While my term in office is ending, the work continues,” Biden said in a speech to
                                    mayors on Friday, one of his last public appearances as president. “Your work
                                    continues.”

                                    Biden’s single term was an eventful one.</p>
                                <p class="about-pera1 mb-25">
                                    He navigated the country out of a generation-defining pandemic, but with a spike in
                                    inflation, fueled in part by his stimulus spending, that prevented the national mood
                                    from fully improving.

                                    He ended Trump-era immigration policies he deemed inhumane, but a surge in illegal
                                    crossings at the US southern border strained state resources and led to backlash,
                                    and he eventually restored many of the same restrictions.

                                    His decision to end the nation’s longest war meant he is the first president in
                                    decades not to hand the Afghanistan conflict to his successor. But the withdrawal
                                    was deadly and chaotic, and left many Americans questioning his competence.</p>
                                <p class="about-pera1 mb-25">
                                    US alliances were restored through common cause when Russia invaded Ukraine. But the
                                    war grinds on, without a clear endgame. In the Middle East, an eleventh-hour
                                    ceasefire was struck in Gaza in exchange for hostages, but he must begrudgingly
                                    share credit with Trump for getting the deal finished.

                                    New investments in American infrastructure and manufacturing have created thousands
                                    of new jobs and invigorated new industries. But even in Biden’s own telling, the
                                    benefits of his record won’t be borne out for years to come.

                                    He restored a degree of normalcy to the presidency after Trump’s norm-busting years
                                    but ignored public sentiment about his advanced age and broke a pledge by pardoning
                                    his son, Hunter.</p>

                                <p class="about-pera1 mb-25">Tariffs are taxes on imported goods.

                                    Typically, the charge is a percentage of a good's value.

                                    For example, a 10% tariff on a $10 product would mean a $1 tax on top - taking the
                                    total cost to $11 (£8.17).

                                    The tax is paid to the government by companies bringing in the foreign products.

                                    These firms may pass some or all of the extra cost on to their customers, which in
                                    this case means ordinary Americans
                                    and other US businesses.

                                    Negotiations continue with a number of countries, including America's top three
                                    trading partners:

                                    China and the US initially threatened tariffs of more than 100% on each other's
                                    goods but later reached a truce. On 30 October, Trump said the two countries would
                                    sign a trade deal "pretty soon", and cancelled tariffs on Chinese goods linked to
                                    fentanyl production. Exclusions on 178 other Chinese products have been extended
                                    until 10 November 2026. Lower tariffs remain in place for non-exempt goods
                                    Canada faces 35% tariffs on its goods - although most are exempt under the existing
                                    US-Canada-Mexico (USMCA) free trade agreement. It is also affected by the blanket
                                    50% levy on imported metals and 25% duty on non-US cars. In October, Trump suspended
                                    talks and threatened to increase Canada's levies by a further 10%, after it
                                    broadcast an anti-tariff advert. Prime Minister Mark Carney later apologised. On 24
                                    January, Trump threatened to introduce a 100% tariff on Canadian goods if the
                                    country agrees a trade deal with China. Trump's threat came days after Carney
                                    announced a "strategic partnership" between the two countries, which will reduce
                                    tariffs on some goods.
                                    Mexico faces 30% tariffs on its goods, plus the sector-specific levies and a 25%
                                    fentanyl levy. However, like Canada, most of its goods are exempt under the USMCA.
                                    The non-exempt tariffs remain suspended while talks continue</p>

                                <p class="about-pera1 mb-25">Trump says tariffs increase the amount of tax raised by the
                                    government, encourage consumers to buy American-made goods and boost investment in
                                    the US.

                                    He wants to reduce the US trade deficit - the gap between the value of goods it buys
                                    from other countries and those it sells to them.

                                    The president argues that the US has been exploited by "cheaters" and "pillaged" by
                                    foreigners.

                                    Trump has also used the taxes to make other demands.

                                    For example, when announcing tariffs against China, Mexico and Canada, he said the
                                    countries must do more to stop migrants and the illegal drug fentanyl reaching the
                                    US.

                                    Trump also threatened additional 10% tariffs on eight European countries which
                                    opposed his plans to take over Greenland, before saying he would not do so.

                                    Some tariffs have been amended, delayed or scrapped after being announced.</p>
                                <p class="about-pera1 mb-25">Some taxes announced by Trump are on particular products,
                                    wherever they are made.

                                    These include:

                                    100% tariff on branded or patented drugs (unless a company is building a factory in
                                    the US)
                                    50% tariff on steel and aluminium imports (except for those from the UK)
                                    50% tariff on copper imports
                                    50% tariff on kitchen and bathroom cabinets and some furniture
                                    25% tariff on most foreign-made cars, engines and other car parts
                                    25% tariff on all heavy-duty trucks
                                </p>
                                <p class="about-pera1 mb-25">
                                    In addition, Trump ended an exemption for imports valued at $800 (£592) or less.

                                    It means low-cost goods are no longer duty-free - a move affecting millions of
                                    packages sent every day, including those from online retailers like Shein and Temu.

                                    The companies shipping the parcels now have to pay duties based on the tariff rate
                                    which applies to the country the goods were sent from. Otherwise, for six months,
                                    they can choose to pay a fixed fee of between $80 and $200 per package.

                                    On 2 January, the White House confirmed it had slashed proposed tariffs of almost
                                    92% on some imported pasta after what it called constructive engagement from firms.

                                    In November, Trump had signed an executive order exempting a range of other food
                                    products from tariffs, including avocados, bananas, beef and coffee because of
                                    domestic shortages.</p>
                                <p class="about-pera1 mb-25">
                                    Trump's tariffs have faced numerous legal challenges.

                                    The Trump administration brought in some of the tariffs using the 1977 International
                                    Emergency Economic Powers Act. Declaring an emergency under the law meant Trump
                                    could bypass Congress.

                                    In August 2025, a US appeals court ruled that most of the tariffs introduced this
                                    way were illegal, but left them in place.

                                    The White House asked the US Supreme Court to overturn that decision. A ruling is
                                    expected soon.

                                    Trump posted on social media that it would be a "complete mess" if the Supreme Court
                                    struck down his tariffs, and warned of difficulties if businesses were told they
                                    could claim refunds.

                                    "It would take many years to figure out what number we are talking about and even,
                                    who, when, and where, to pay," he said.</p>
                                <p class="about-pera1 mb-25">
                                    Some products have become more expensive - including toys, appliances and furniture
                                    as well as certain foodstuffs.

                                    US inflation was 2.7% in the 12 months to December, down from 3% in September, but
                                    up from 2.4% in April, before most tariffs started.

                                    Many firms say they are passing on the cost of tariffs to US customers, including
                                    Target, Walmart and Adidas.

                                    The cost of goods manufactured in the US using imported components is also expected
                                    to rise.

                                    For example, car parts typically cross the US, Mexican and Canadian borders multiple
                                    times before a vehicle is completely assembled.</p>

                                    Since at least 2012, Americans have been more likely to say there are strong
                                    conflicts between Democrats and Republicans than exist between other groups in U.S.
                                    society, such as rich and poor people, young and older people, and black and white
                                    people.
                                    But as a contentious political year unfolds, the share of adults who see strong
                                    partisan conflicts – particularly the share who perceive very strong conflicts
                                    between Democrats and Republicans – is much higher today than in 2016 or 2012, when
                                    the last two presidential elections took place.
                                    About nine-in-ten Americans (91%) say that conflicts between the party coalitions
                                    are either strong or very strong, according to a Pew Research Center survey in
                                    January. About seven-in-ten (71%) say these conflicts are very strong.</p>

                                    partisans and other groups in society, we surveyed 1,504 U.S. adults in January
                                    2020. Everyone who took part is a member of Pew Research Center’s American Trends
                                    Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random
                                    sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of
                                    selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population
                                    by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories.
                                    Read more about the ATP’s methodology.</p>
                                <p class="about-pera1 mb-25">Here are the questions asked for this report, along with
                                    responses, and its methodology.

                                    The perception of these partisan divisions far overshadows that of conflicts between
                                    other groups in American society.

                                    A narrower majority of adults (59%) say strong or very strong conflicts exist
                                    between rich people and poor people, including 31% who say these conflicts are very
                                    strong. About half of Americans (53%) say there are strong conflicts between black
                                    and white people, although just 19% say these conflicts are very strong.
                                </p>
                                <p class="about-pera1 mb-25">
                                    Fewer than half of Americans say there are strong or very strong conflicts between
                                    young people and older people (41%) or between people who live in cities and those
                                    in rural areas (40%).

                                    Both Republicans and GOP-leaning independents (94%) and Democrats and Democratic
                                    leaners (92%) overwhelmingly see strong conflicts between the two parties, and
                                    seven-in-ten or more in both parties say they are very strong (75% of Republicans
                                    and 71% of Democrats). Liberal Democrats are more likely to say the conflicts are
                                    very strong than moderate and conservative Democrats (75% vs. 66%). Similarly,
                                    conservative Republicans more often say this than moderate and liberal Republicans
                                    (80% vs. 65%).

                                    Americans are now substantially more likely to see very strong conflicts between
                                    Democrats and Republicans than they were in the past. When the Center first asked
                                    the question in December 2012, 47% of Americans characterized partisan conflicts as
                                    very strong. Four years later, in December 2016, 56% said this, and 71% see these
                                    conflicts as very strong today.

                                    This trend is consistent with rising partisan antipathy over the last several years,
                                    including larger shares in each party associating negative traits with members of
                                    the opposing party and rating the opposing partisans negatively.</p>

                                    While there are only modest partisan differences in the shares saying there are
                                    strong conflicts between young and older people or between people in cities and
                                    those in rural areas, Democrats and Democratic leaners are much more likely than
                                    Republicans and Republican leaners to say there are strong or very strong conflicts
                                    between the rich and the poor (77% vs. 40%, respectively) and between white people
                                    and black people (69% vs. 36%).</p>
                                <p class="about-pera1 mb-25">
                                    By relatively wide margins, black Americans are more likely than whites to say they
                                    see strong or very strong conflicts between the two racial groups (70% vs. 47%) and
                                    between the rich and poor (74% vs. 56%). Similarly, black Americans (51%) are
                                    somewhat more likely than whites (38%) to say these conflicts exist between young
                                    and older people. These differences are much less pronounced when accounting for
                                    partisanship – for instance, 73% of black Democrats and 66% of white Democrats say
                                    there are strong or very strong conflicts between white and black people.

                                    Adults under the age of 30 are somewhat more likely to report strong or very strong
                                    conflicts between older and younger people – 51% say this, compared with about
                                    four-in-ten of those in older age groups.</p>

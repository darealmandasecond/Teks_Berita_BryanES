                                    Last month, the European Union and Indonesia concluded negotiations on a free trade
                                    deal, called the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement. The two sides had
                                    been negotiating the pact for nearly a decade, but things gathered steam only in
                                    July when Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto traveled to Brussels and announced
                                    that a political agreement had been reached. The final version emerged soon after,
                                    and now will await review and ratification before going into effect, likely in 2027.

                                <p class="about-pera1 mb-25">What does this agreement do for each side, and why did it
                                    come together so quickly? Indonesia agreed to remove high duties on certain
                                    industrial products imported from the EU, including motor vehicles, machinery,
                                    electrical equipment, pharmaceuticals, and chemicals. It also eliminates duties on
                                    European agri-food products such as dairy, meat and processed foods. Indonesian rice
                                    and sugar, which play a key role in domestic agriculture, will remain protected.
                                    Around 80 percent of the tariff reductions will take place when the agreement goes
                                    into effect, and the rest will be phased in over a five-year period.</p>
                                <p class="about-pera1 mb-25">CEU duties on most Indonesian goods will be eliminated. The
                                    agreement also streamlines regulatory standards and processes, and looks to improve
                                    non-tariff barriers like licensing and certifications. For instance, if Germany
                                    exports a car to Indonesia that has already been certified under EU standards,
                                    Indonesia is required to accept the certification and not subject the car to
                                    re-testing. There are also mechanisms for information sharing and dispute
                                    resolution.
                                </p>
                                <p class="about-pera1 mb-25">
                                    It’s a relatively straightforward free trade agreement, the goal of which is to
                                    remove frictions and increase the flow of goods and investment between the two
                                    parties. According to government data, the EU invested $3.6 billion in Indonesia in
                                    2024, led by the Netherlands with investments in the food, energy, transportation,
                                    and chemical industries totaling almost $2 billion. Under the agreement, Indonesia
                                    will open up several more sectors, including finance, manufacturing, telecom, and
                                    mining. This should increase investment from the EU in the years ahead, which is
                                    clearly a priority for the Indonesian government.
                                    Indonesia currently runs a bilateral trade surplus with the EU. According to the
                                    central bank, Indonesia exported $17.3 billion worth of goods and services to the EU
                                    last year, and imported $12.8 billion. Indonesia’s primary exports are palm oil and
                                    other commodities, while it imports a lot of services and higher-value finished
                                    goods like chemicals. The agreement is expected to give a boost to European farmers,
                                    while Indonesian palm oil and textile exporters also stand to benefit.</p>

                                    This deal cannot be divorced from the broader churn in the global economy. In April,
                                    the United States announced sweeping tariffs on the world, including Indonesia and
                                    Europe. A trade deal between Indonesia and the EU, which had been making incremental
                                    progress for nearly a decade, suddenly coming together within months of Trump’s
                                    tariffs is quite the coincidence. As the United States looks to disrupt the global
                                    economy for reasons that are not always clear, countries around the world are making
                                    their own plans.
                                    In particular, there is some urgency in Indonesia to find new export markets for
                                    textiles. In 2023, Indonesia exported $20 billion in textiles, $7.7 billion of which
                                    went to the United States. Even before this year’s tariff drama, the textile
                                    industry in Indonesia was being battered, with high-profile bankruptcies and mass
                                    layoffs. If a free trade deal with the EU helps Indonesia find new markets for
                                    textile exports, while boosting investment inflows, it will probably be seen as a
                                    pretty solid win. It also underscores the importance of diversifying beyond the U.S.
                                    during these turbulent times.</p>

                                    A few sticking points remain, and they have to do mainly with commodities. One is
                                    palm oil. The recently enacted European Union Deforestation Regulation requires
                                    suppliers of certain commodities, including palm oil, to meet sustainability
                                    standards to gain access to the EU market. Indonesia and Malaysia supply the
                                    majority of the world’s palm out. They have fiercely opposed the requirements,
                                    arguing that they place an excessive regulatory burden on producers, and especially
                                    smallholders. Last year, the EU pushed the deadline for compliance back.
                                    Another contentious issue has been Indonesia’s nickel downstreaming policy. For
                                    several years, Indonesia has banned the export of unprocessed nickel ore in an
                                    attempt to force foreign investors to build local smelters and refine the nickel in
                                    Indonesia. The EU filed a complaint against the export ban at the WTO. It’s unclear
                                    whether or how the new agreement will impact these ongoing tensions. That a free
                                    trade deal between the two sides came together so quickly, and in spite of these
                                    unsettled issues, speaks to the urgency with which countries around the world are
                                    looking to make back-up plans as the global economy becomes an increasingly
                                    uncertain and risky place.</p>

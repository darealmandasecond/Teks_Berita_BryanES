                                <h3>Trump Consoles Erika Kirk After Charlie Kirk's Death This Is Kirk's Story</h3>
                            </div>
                            <div class="about-prea">
                                <p class="about-pera1 mb-25">When the right-wing American activist and influencer
                                    Charlie Kirk was shot dead aged 31, he was speaking at the kind of university event
                                    that helped propel him to social media stardom.</p>
                                <p class="about-pera1 mb-25">Kirk was just 18 when he co-founded Turning Point USA, a
                                    student organisation focused on spreading conservative ideas on college campuses. As
                                    he was killed with a single bullet, he was speaking under a sign that read: 'Prove
                                    me wrong'.</p>
                                <p class="about-pera1 mb-25">
                                    At these events, Kirk became known for his combative style, inviting students to
                                    step up to the microphone and challenge his right-wing Christian worldview in front
                                    of a baying audience.

                                    Clips of these exchanges built him a huge following - more than 5m followers on X
                                    and 7m on TikTok - that helped him mobilise the youth vote for President Donald
                                    Trump, who has repeatedly praised Kirk for inspiring a generation of young
                                    conservative activists.

                                    "He's got this army of young people," Trump told the Turning Point Action Conference
                                    last year. "These are young patriots. We thank you, Charlie."

                                    After Kirk's death on 10 September, Trump said he had once told him he could become
                                    president one day.</p>

                                <p class="about-pera1 mb-25">Born in 1993, to an architect father and stock trader
                                    mother, Kirk grew up in the well-to-do Chicago suburb of Prospect Heights. He
                                    attended an Illinois community college briefly, before dropping out to devote
                                    himself to political activism.</p>
                                <p class="about-pera1 mb-25">He also applied unsuccessfully to West Point, the elite US
                                    military academy. Kirk often referred tongue-in-cheek to his lack of a college
                                    degree when debating students and academics, revelling in his reputation as a deft
                                    public speaker and fluent debater.
                                </p>
                                <p class="about-pera1 mb-25">
                                    During his rapid ascent in public life, Kirk, who was always willing to say things
                                    that could rouse his supporters and offend his critics, used YouTube, TikTok,
                                    Facebook and Instagram to spread his message and build his audience.

                                    He was one of the youngest speakers when he appeared aged 22 at the Republican
                                    National Convention in 2016 and his platform grew further when his hugely successful
                                    podcast, The Charlie Kirk Show, began in 2019.

                                    Julia Pierce, a member of Turning Point USA for more than a decade, said he would be
                                    remembered for giving young conservatives in America the confidence to be
                                    themselves.</p>
                                <p class="about-pera1 mb-25">
                                    "It used to be that for young people it was cool to be a Democrat. But he made it
                                    cool to be a Trump supporter and to wear the Maga hat and live your life with
                                    traditional family values," she told the BBC after his death.

                                    Kirk's de facto role as communicator - and defender - in chief for the Make America
                                    Great Again (Maga) movement on college campuses distinguished him from other
                                    right-wing activists because of his willingness to take his fight into
                                    conventionally hostile settings.

                                    "When you pierce the liberal echo chamber, minds are changed… millions of them in
                                    fact," he wrote in one X post. "The campus left is threatened by debate, dialogue,
                                    discussion, and differing ideas," he said in another.</p>
                                <p class="about-pera1 mb-25">
                                    Kirk was holding a "Prove me Wrong" debate at Utah Valley University when he was
                                    killed, the latest stop in a tour of colleges around the country. This summer, he
                                    also visited the UK and debated students at the University of Oxford and University
                                    of Cambridge.

                                    His team would record all of them, posting short clips of the most heated exchanges
                                    online, and they followed a similar model to the "You're Being Brainwashed" tour he
                                    held across campuses in the run-up to the 2024 election.

                                    On stage, in TV appearances and on his podcast, he would often defend the right-wing
                                    populist and nationalist thinking that is central to the Maga movement.

                                    Kirk would invite students to challenge him directly on these views, and his stances
                                    on issues such as immigration, transgender rights, abortion, diversity programmes
                                    and climate change often provoked the fiercest exchanges and loudest criticism.

                                    On an episode of the online show "Surrounded", for example, Kirk was asked if he had
                                    a 10-year-old daughter who was raped and became pregnant whether he would want her
                                    to have the baby.

                                    "The answer is yes, the baby would be delivered," Kirk said.</p>

                                    might have been very different for global politics had Stalin not been around.
                                    During his time as Soviet leader, he oversaw the Allied victory against Nazi Germany
                                    and the worsening of relations between the Soviet Union and the United States.

                                    Stalin is also considered one of the most dangerous totalitarian leaders in history,
                                    his violent excesses often compared to those of Adolf Hitler. Here are 10 facts
                                    about Joseph Stalin.</p>
                                <p class="about-pera1 mb-25"> Smallpox as a child left him with lasting scars and a
                                    deformity
                                    Born into poverty in 1878 to an alcoholic cobbler father and washerwoman mother,
                                    Stalin caught smallpox at the age of seven and was left with pockmarks on his face
                                    and a slightly deformed left arm. He was bullied by other children while also
                                    enduring beatings at the hands of his father.</p>
                                <p class="about-pera1 mb-25">
                                    His mother sent him to study to become a priest
                                    In December 1895, Stalin’s mother sent him to a seminary in the Georgian capital of
                                    Tiflis (modern-day Tbilisi). He rebelled against studying scripture, however,
                                    instead reading the writings of Karl Marx and joining a local socialist group.
                                    Eventually he became an atheist, and in 1899 was expelled from the seminary for
                                    failing to attend exams.
                                    His nom de guerre means “man of the steel hand”
                                    Stalin was born Ioseb (Joseph) Besarionis dze Jughashvili. But, like other Russian
                                    revolutionaries, including Vladimir Lenin, he later adopted the alias by which he is
                                    now best known.
                                    At one point he lived in the Kremlin with Lenin and Leon Trotsky
                                    Following the October Revolution of 1917, the three men became part of an informal
                                    group leading the new Bolshevik government. This group was completed by Yakov
                                    Sverdlov, though he died little more than a year later. When the government moved
                                    from Petrograd (formerly Saint Petersburg) to Moscow in March 1918 due to the
                                    ongoing world war, it based itself in the Kremlin. And it was there that all four
                                    men lived.</p>

                                    When Lenin died in 1924, he was succeeded by Alexei Rykov as chairman of the Council
                                    of People’s Commissars, and thus the head of the government. Stalin, meanwhile,
                                    remained general secretary of the Communist Party. But he immediately set about
                                    promoting himself as Lenin’s true political successor.

                                    By the late 1920s he had established himself as the supreme leader of the party,
                                    though there is some debate over when the Soviet system of governance evolved from
                                    an oligarchy to a dictatorship under Stalin.

                                <p class="about-pera1 mb-25"> …exiling Trotsky in the process
                                    After Lenin’s death a bitter power struggle broke out between Stalin and and the
                                    more idealistic Trotsky. Both sides had their supporters – Lenin himself had said
                                    before he died that Trotsky should replace Stalin as general secretary of the
                                    Communist Party. But in the end Stalin won out, exiling Trotsky to Kazakhstan in
                                    1928 before deporting him from the Soviet Union altogether the following year.

                                    Eleven years later, Stalin dealt Trotsky the ultimate blow and had him assassinated
                                    in Mexico City.

                                    He developed his own brand of Marxism
                                    Like Lenin before him, Stalin also had his own interpretation of Marxism. In
                                    Stalin’s case this interpretation was very nationalistic and focused on building up
                                    the Soviet Union rather than on global revolution.

                                    He oversaw the country’s industrialisation
                                    Fearing that communism would fail if the Soviet Union did not modernise, from the
                                    late 1920s Stalin began initiating a series of brutal five-year plans to
                                    industrialise the still almost feudal country. Under his leadership, the production
                                    of coal, oil and steel grew exponentially and the country saw huge economic growth.
                                    But these gains came at a huge human cost.

                                    People were forced into leaving their homes to work in factories where they laboured
                                    in terrible conditions – and those who refused were killed. At least 5 million
                                    people are believed to have died during this industrialisation process.</p>

                                    He ordered the 1940 Katyn Massacre
                                    One of the most ruthless political leaders in history, the deaths attributed to
                                    Stalin number in their millions. Among the dead are the estimated 22,000 Polish
                                    prisoners of war who were executed by the Soviet secret police in April and May
                                    1940. The Soviet Union initially blamed the Nazis for the killings and it wasn’t
                                    until 1990 that it admitted responsibility.</p>

                                    His eldest child died in a Nazi concentration camp
                                    Stalin’s son from his first marriage, Yakov, was a soldier in the Red Army during
                                    World War Two and was either captured or surrendered in the initial stages of the
                                    German invasion of the Soviet Union. The Nazis proposed to free him in a prisoner
                                    swap but Stalin refused, possibly because he believed that Yakov had surrendered
                                    voluntarily. He died in Sachsenhausen concentration camp in 1943..</p>
